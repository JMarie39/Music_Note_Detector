A student-project which aims to create an effective and user-friendly **musical note detector** that can identify the notes by determining the frequency of the input note using MATLAB.

### Contents:

- [mp3_Notes](mp3_Notes) - Folder that contains the piano notes.
- [detectNote.m](detectNote.m) - Script for detecting the note.
- [ff.m](ff.m) - Script for identifying the fundamental frequency.
- [findPitch.m](findPitch.m) - Script for finding the pitch.
- [hps.m](hps.m) - Script for determining the harmonic product spectrum.
- [main.m](main.m) - Main file in order to run the program.
- [oct.m](oct.m) - Script for identifying the octave.
- [Documentation](Documentation) - Program documentation.

### Instructions:

- Run the [main.m](main.m) in MATLAB.
- Enter the file name of the note along with its file extension (the note should be found in the [mp3_Notes](mp3_Notes) folder).
- After enterring the file name, the output should display in the command window.
